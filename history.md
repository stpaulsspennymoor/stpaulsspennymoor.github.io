<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: larger">The Church has stood on Whitworth Terrace since its consecration in 1858. In 1880, the north aisle (the present Lady Chapel) was added and in 1890 the tower. A clock for the tower was added in 1898 and the following year tenants of the Shafto estates, together with parishioners donated the chimes. Eight tubular bells were placed in the tower, which were used and repaired until the 1960s when they became unsafe.<br>&#160;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="font-size: medium"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: larger"><img border="1" hspace="5" alt="The Church on fire" align="right" width="250" height="180" src="/assets/Church fire(1).jpg"/></span></span>The fire of 1953</span></strong></span></p><p></p><p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: larger">It was St James’ Day, Saturday 25th July 1953 that disaster struck. A huge fire ripped through the building and reduced the church to a ruin with only the walls standing. A local man, a miner, was later convicted of deliberately setting fire to the church. It is believed he had a grudge against the church, because in the previous month he had been convicted of stealing the communion wine!</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: larger">The task of rebuilding the church was immense and took more than three years to complete at a cost of around £26,000. In rebuilding the church, a spacious and open chancel and sanctuary were achieved by locating the choir-stalls and organ at the west end of the building. The former high altar was refurbished and is now in the Lady Chapel. A new high altar was installed and proves a stunning focal piece.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: larger"><img border="1" hspace="5" alt="The patchwork stained glass window" align="left" width="250" height="139" src="/assets/Patchwork.jpg"/>Of the original stained glass windows only two remained – the St Paul window above the Lady Chapel and that at the west end of the aisle. A ‘patchwork’ window, composed of some of the fragments of glass from windows shattered in the fire was placed in the north transept above the door to the servers’ vestry.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: larger">The chancel roof was decorated with a medieval geometric design, enriched with colour and gold-leaf, contrasting with the simpler treatment of the barrel-vaulted nave and north aisle roof. The pulpit was restored whilst the old font was provided with a new oak cover, a small repetition of the pyramid spire on the tower.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: larger">After three long years the church was re-consecrated and reopened for worship on November 1st 1956. The reopening coincided with a visit from the late Queen Mother who was passing through the region. During her short visit to the Church, she remarked on the “bold use of colour” when looking up at the ceilings.<br>&#160;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="font-size: medium">50th Anniversary Celebrations</span></strong></span></p><p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: larger"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: larger"><img border="1" hspace="5" alt="50th anniversary service in 2006" align="right" width="250" height="179" src="/assets/Anniversary service.jpg"/></span></span>In 2006 the parish church celebrated its golden anniversary with a series of events and it all kicked off with the release of 50 golden balloons to start the year-long celebrations.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: larger">It was on November 1st when the focus turned to the Anniversary of Re-consecration service when the Bishop of Durham, The Rt. Revd Tom Wright joined past and present clergy to give thanks for the last 50 years of worship.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: larger">During his sermon Bishop Tom said; “This church has a great feel and is a great place to worship. We thank God for his presence here and for all that has gone on over the last 50 years and beyond”.<br>&#160;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>New Creation East Window</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: larger"><img border="1" hspace="5" alt="New Creation East Window" align="left" width="250" height="208" src="/assets/Chancel.jpg"/>To mark the golden anniversary celebrations in 2006 it was decided to install a new stained glass window above the altar at the east end of the church.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: larger">The fire of 1953 destroyed the original stained glass design and when the architect redesigned the church it was decided leave the glass clear to allow natural light to flood the chancel and the altar.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: larger">In December 2005 we learnt of a bequest from a faithful member of the church. It was their request that the money be put towards a fund for a new stained glass window to replace the one lost in the fire.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: larger">Following the bequest, a number of donations were received and in early 2007 we reached our target of raising £10,000.<br>&#160;<br>The theme of the window is 'New Creation' and the Parochial Church Council commissioned architectural glass artist, Alan Davis to produce the new window and it was installed and dedicated in November 2007.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: larger">Commenting at the time, the Revd Lynda Gough, said: "The window will be a constant reminder of God's faithful love to us from generation to generation".<br>&#160;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>Vicars<br></strong></span><span style="font-size: larger">1875 – Revd John Gaskill <br>1900 – Revd Joseph Short <br>1915 – Revd George Robinson Cook <br>1927 – Revd Frederick Potter Bates <br>1939 – Revd Kenneth Moir Carey <br>1944 – Revd Leonard Maro Schiff <br>1947 – Revd Gordon Robertson Berriman <br>1958 – Revd Colin Brennen <br>1978 – Revd Richard Andrew Hugh Greany <br>1984 – Revd Nigel Charles Griffin <br>1992-2002 – Revd John Stuart Bain<br>2003-2011 – Revd Lynda Elizabeth Gough<br></span></span><span style="font-size: 13px;">2013-present – Revd Matthew Paul Tarling</span></p>
