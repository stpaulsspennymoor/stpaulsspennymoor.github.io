Here at St Paul's church we take our approach to safeguarding seriously in order to protect children and vulnerable adults. 

Our parish follows the guidelines set out in the Durham Diocesan policy and the Parochial Church Council has adopted its own policies.

Copies of the safeguarding policies are available below.
