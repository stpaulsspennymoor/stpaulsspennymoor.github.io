<span style="font-size: medium;">**Music**</span>\\
Music is very important in the life of our church. We have an enthusiastic choir, who lead the congregation in singing a wide range of hymns and songs, accompanied by organ, piano and other instruments.

<span style="font-size: medium;">**Trekkers**</span>\\
This is our Sunday morning children's ministry. The weekly session from 10.30-11.15am is for children aged between 3 and 11 and is designed to introduce them to the Christian faith in a fun and creative way. The session lasts for approximately 45 minutes before everyone comes back into church for the rest of the main Sunday service.

<span style="font-size: medium;">**Play Church**</span>\\
Pre-school children and their parents/ carers are invited to this informal and relaxed style of worship every Friday morning from 10-11.30am in church. There are games, activities, crafts, song and dance and aims to introduce people to Jesus and God through hospitality, friendship, fun and laughter!

Our uniformed organisations meet on Thursday evenings at the St Paul’s Centre. For more information about registering your child, please contact Susan Soppitt on 01388 810976.

<span style="font-size: medium;">**Shared Ministry**</span>\\
In September 2010, St Paul’s was commissioned as a Shared Ministry Church by the Bishop of Jarrow. A small team of people was also commissioned as the church’s first Shared Ministry Development Team and it is their role to look at our mission and outreach to the community.

<span style="font-size: medium">**Cafe Church <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">_(currently suspended due to the pandemic)_</span>**</span>\\
As part of our continued commitment to reaching out to the community, every Wednesday morning we have Cafe Church. It is an opportunity for people to come and use the building for prayer, quiet time, or reflection. The clergy and lay members of our team are always available if visitors would like to talk to someone. Light refreshments are also available.
