<span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Music</strong></span><br>Music is very important in the life of our church. We have an enthusiastic choir, who lead the congregation in singing a wide range of hymns and songs, accompanied by organ, piano and other instruments.

<strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Trekkers</span></strong><br>This is our Sunday morning children's ministry. The weekly session from 10.30-11.15am is for children aged between 3 and 11 and is designed to introduce them to the Christian faith in a fun and creative way. The session lasts for approximately 45 minutes before everyone comes back into church for the rest of the main Sunday service.
