During the service you are declaring that you will bring up the child in the Christian faith. If you feel you are not able to make the promises, then we can talk to you about an alternative service of thanksgiving for your child. This is a very personal and individual service.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: #000000"><strong><span style="font-size: larger">Cost – </span></strong><span style="font-size: larger">there is no charge for a Baptism.
