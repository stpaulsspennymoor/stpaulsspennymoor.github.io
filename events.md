## CHOCOLATE EVENING - CALLING ALL TEENAGERS!

Come and craft some chocolate with us! A professional chocolatier will be leading us in working with chocolate, crafting something yummy for you to then take away. The evening costs just Â£2 per person, and will include chocolate tasting, snacks and a short talk about the Christian faith. This evening is brought to you subsidised by Spennymoor Churches Holiday Club. We can't wait to see you there!
