Trekkers is the name for our Sunday morning children's ministry and meets in the adjacent St Paul's Centre. The session is for children aged between 3 and 11 and is designed to introduce them to the Christian faith in a fun and creative way. The session lasts for approximately 45 minutes before everyone comes across into church for the rest of the Sunday morning service.
