Details of our regular services are given below. For our special services and events, visit our page at [A Church Near You](https://www.achurchnearyou.com/church/13565/).

## Sundays

10.30am - Holy Communion with activities for children and young people including refreshments\\

10:30am - All Together on the first Sunday of every month with refreshments served before and after the service!
It's about 45 minutes long and ideal whether you're used to worshipping with us or not. It's called 'All Together' because we've designed it to enable everyone to worship together in their own way. Refreshments will be available from 10:15am, with the service starting at 10:30am. Come and join us!

Trekkers is the name for our Sunday morning children's ministry and meets in the adjacent St Paul's Centre. The session is for children aged between 3 and 11 and is designed to introduce them to the Christian faith in a fun and creative way. The session lasts for approximately 45 minutes before everyone comes across into church for the rest of the Sunday morning service.

## Wednesdays

9.30am - Holy Communion followed by refreshments

## Fridays (during term time)

10-11.30am - Play Church - interactive worship for pre-school children and their parents/ carers
