## Sundays

10.30am - Holy Communion with activities for children and young people including refreshments

10.30am - All Together on the first Sunday of every month\\
It's about 45 minutes long and ideal whether you're used to worshipping with us or not. It's called 'All Together' because we've designed it to enable everyone to worship together in their own way. Refreshments will be available from 10:15am, with the service starting at 10:30am. Come and join us!

[_**The service is live-streamed on our Facebook page.**_](https://www.facebook.com/stpaulsspennymoor){:target="_blank"}

Trekkers is the name for our Sunday morning children's ministry and meets in the adjacent St Paul's Centre. The session is for children aged between 3 and 11 and is designed to introduce them to the Christian faith in a fun and creative way. The session lasts for approximately 45 minutes before everyone comes across into church for the rest of the Sunday morning service.

## Wednesdays

9.30am - Holy Communion followed by refreshments

## Fridays (during term time)

10-11.30am - Play Church - interactive worship for pre-school children and their parents/ carers
